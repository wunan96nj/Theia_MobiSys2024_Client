The client-side component runs on Unreal Engine 4.26. The client device is the Microsoft HoloLens 2 MR headset. In this repository, we provide the client demo in the format of an Unreal Engine project that can run on the Windows OS. The project can be easily packaged and deployed to HoloLens 2.

Instructions:

1) Open the Unreal Engine project and modify the IP address at line 319 of the cpp file at GaPe/Source/PointCloud/PointCloudRenderer.cpp to match the serverâ€™s IP address.
2) Compile the project with Unreal Engine 4.26.
